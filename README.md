Modularjs Underscore takes original Underscore.js library and breaks it into separate AMD Modules.

Features that are not present in Modularjs Underscore:
- chaining
- mixin utility
- template settings (only default EJB-style settings are applied)


Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides
support for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...)
without extending any core JavaScript objects.
